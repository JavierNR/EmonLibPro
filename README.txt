* Example folder contains an Arduino Library Demo.


Energy monitor Library Pro 
Based on emonTx hardware from OpenEnergyMonitor http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/

Generic library for any voltage and current sensors.
Interrupt based, implements a zero cross detector and phase-locked loop for better precision.
Completely line frequency independent.

Reports Voltage, Frequency, Current, Active Power, Aparent Power and Power Factor.

This library idea cames from ATMEL AVR465: Single-Phase Power/Energy Meter.

Edit configuration in EmonLibPro.h.
